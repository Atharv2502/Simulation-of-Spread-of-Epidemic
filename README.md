# Simulation-of-Spread-of-Epidemic

The project aims to form a model to predict spread of an epidemic under different conditions using agent based modelling. Using the outputs of the model policymakers and health officials can make predictions about the future course of spread and test various intervention strategies to get it under control.

The model is developed using Agent Based Modelling, using Python as the programming language. The technical aspects invloved in this model are as follows: 
• Agent Based Modelling to perform Individual interactions
• Categorization of Population based on both the Age and Occupation of Agents/Individuals
• Interaction Matrix (used to determine the probability and strength of interaction between two agents/individuals)
• Multiprocessing (for better performance)
• Python Libraries (Numpy for faster storage access)
• Statistical Inferencing to extract valuable information from the outputs (Super-spreaders, Rate of Transmission, etc.)
